	<h5><u>Prey and predators</u></h5>
	<li>Like many other organisms, fish live in complex ecosystems where they interact as both predators and prey with a variety of species.
	Depending on the species and the environment they live in, fish might have different predators and prey.</li>
	<l><u>Listed below are a few typical instances:</u></l><br><br>
	<li><u> (A) Predators of Fishes-----></u></li><br>
	<section class="predators-data" id="data"></section>

	<h9 style="padding: 2%;"></h9><l>    <u>        (i) Birds-				</u> </l></h9><ol>Fish is a known food source for numerous bird species, including ospreys, eagles, kingfishers, and herons. To capture fish from the water, they employ their keen beaks and talons.Predator birds with keen vision include hawks and eagles.They can see fish swimming close to the surface from a great height because of this.They pursue and capture fish by swimming underwater. Their enormous bills and swollen throat pouches are used to lift fish out of the water also they approach their prey cautiously and without disturbing the water by using their long legs and necks. </ol><br>
	<h9 style="padding: 2%;"></h9><l>    <u>       (ii) Mammals-				</u> </l><ol>A few mammals are proficient fishers, including seals, sea lions, otters, and bears. A large number of fish-eating mammals are perfectly suited to living in water.Their limbs are adapted for swimming, and their bodies are sleek and powerful.They can move through water with greater efficiency thanks to these changes.Certain marine mammals utilize echolocation to find and track fish underwater. These animals include dolphins and some kinds of whales.When hunting fish, some mammals, such as river otters and bears, may employ patience and stealth.</ol><br>
	<h9 style="padding: 2%;"></h9><l>    <u>       (iii) Reptiles-				</u> </l><ol>In freshwater settings, several reptiles—such as crocodiles and alligators—are known to pursue fish.To capture fish swimming in the water, they might employ a mix of stealth, ambush, and quick strikes.It is well known that aquatic turtles, including softshell and snapping turtles, are adept hunters.Alligators and crocodiles are powerful water predators. When prey comes too close to the water's edge, they use their strong jaws and fangs to catch them.Some monitor lizard species are known to chase fish and are skilled swimmers, such as the water monitor.</ol><br>
	<li><u> (B) Preys of Fishes-----></u></li><br>
	<h9 style="padding: 2%;"></h9><l>    <u>       (i) Amphibians-				</u> </l><ol>Amphibians are known to be preyed upon by fish, especially in the aquatic and larval phases of their life cycles.A variety of fish species may target amphibians during this delicate aquatic stage.Fish may easily obtain tadpoles because they are abundant in aquatic environments and can be either herbivorous or omnivore.Amphibian eggs deposited in the water can be eaten by fish.Fish can still feed on the developing larvae of amphibians even after they hatch.In aquatic environments, fish, particularly those with predatory tendencies, may participate in ambush predation.</ol>
	<h9 style="padding: 2%;"></h9><l>    <u>       (ii) Mollusks-				</u> </l><ol>To break through mollusk shells, several fish species have developed powerful jaws and teeth. Certain fish species have evolved to be skilled mollusk predators, with specific characteristics that enable them to catch and devour these invertebrates with ease.Predatory fish that live in locations with high mollusk populations often employ this tactic.When a fish uses suction to feed, it quickly expands its mouth to create suction and pulls water and food into it.</ol>
